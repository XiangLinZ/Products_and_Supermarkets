# Introduction
Dia and Mercadona are both very important supermarkets in Spain, as any supermarket, they have a large amount of products and sections, splited by categories and subcategories. Most people make their basic and not that basic purchases on that kind of supermarkets, so I wanted to to analize those products and supermarkets to finaly get some kind of revelations üôåüôå.

# Objetives


- This is my first project during [IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/es) Data Analytics bootcamp, so many things still need a bit of polishment.
- One basic target is to start with a dataset and clean it.
- Another requirement it's to scrap adicional data and enrich our main dataset.
- Also, we need to make a DataBase, I did it on [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).
- And lastly, we had to make some basic visualizations and get our conclusions.

# Data

- My starting dataset it's a very well know dataset about supermarkets, a sort version can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamarket/productos-de-supermercados).
- Adicional data was taken from [Mercadona](https://tienda.mercadona.es/) and [Dia](https://www.dia.es/compra-online/), I had to use Selenium to scrap Mercadona's data and BeautifulSoup to scrap Dia's data.
- I made my own data pipeline in order to clean and manipulate all the data, also a library that is used by the functions on my pipeline, all this can be found in [src](https://github.com/XiangLinZ/Proyecto_1_ETL/tree/main/src) folder.
- Also, I'm so sorry if there is some titles and variables in Spanish...
didn't though that i had to translate everything to English, so if there is something that isn't translated fell free to ask me! üëçüëç.

# Conclusion
